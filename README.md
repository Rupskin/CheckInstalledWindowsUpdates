# CheckInstalledWindowsUpdates
Script intended for use in an already established monitoring system that monitors the Windows Update log

This repo is WIP. I just set this up for [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/aavocr/after_6_months_of_testing_this_in_my_company_i/). I'll provide more info for it in the near future. Until then, good luck.

If you have made any improvments to the script i'd be happy if you share them back. This thing was used internally only, so a lot of it is still ugly hacks and duplicated strings.
